  Create two functions: odd() and even()<br>
  The function even() returns a list of all the even numbers from sample_data<br>
  The function odd() returns a list of all the odd numbers from sample_data<br>

  Create a function sum_of_numbers() which will accept the sample data and/or a function.<br>
  If a function is not passed, the sum_of_numbers() should return the sum of all the numbers from sample_data<br>
	If a function is passed, the sum_of_numbers() should return the sum of numbers returned from the function passed.<br>

	1. The number and its double should have exactly the same number of digits.<br>
	2. Both the numbers should have the same digits ,but in different order.<br>

Otherwise it should return False.<br>

Assume that the following information are given:<br>
Price per litre of fuel = 70<br>
Mileage of the bus in km/litre of fuel = 10<br>
Price(Rs) per ticket = 80<br>

The bus runs on multiple routes having different distance in kms and number of passengers.<br>
Write a function to calculate and return the profit earned (Rs) in each route. Return -1 in case of loss.<br>
