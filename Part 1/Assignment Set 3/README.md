Based on their performance and behavior during the camp, the teacher rewards them with chocolates.<br>
    Write a Python function to<br>
    1. Find the total number of chocolates received by all the children put together. Assume that each child is identified by an id and it is stored in a tuple and the number of     chocolates given to each child is stored in a list.
    2. The teacher also rewards a child with few extra chocolates for his/her best conduct during the camp. <br>
    3. If the number of extra chocolates is less than 1, an error message "Extra chocolates is less than 1", should be displayed.<br>
    4. If the given child Id is invalid, an error message "Child id is invalid" should be displayed. Otherwise, the extra chocolates provided for the child must be added to         his/her existing number of chocolates and display the list containing the total number of chocolates received by each child.<br>
